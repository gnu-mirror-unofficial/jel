                   NEW FEATURES in version 2.0.1.

This release provides a minor feature enchancement and the license upgrade.

1. GPLv3 license

  Starting with this release JEL is distributed under GNU GPLv3.

2. Security context inheritance.

  JEL-compiled expressions now execute in the same security context
  (ProtectionDomain) as JEL itself (specifically, as gnu.jel.ImageLoader
  class). This should permit easy integration of JEL into the signed
  web-distributed Applets, running with SecurityManager enabled. Previously
  JEL-generated code ran as completely "untrusted". Now it is possible
  to call protected functions (such as System.getProperty), provided they
  are registered with gnu.jel.Library, from within JEL expressions.

  Please be more careful now with planning abd design of your gnu.jel.Library.


                       PLANNED FEATURES

1. Allowing to call methods with variable number of arguments in JEL
   expressions.
