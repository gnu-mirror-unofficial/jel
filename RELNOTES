                   NEW FEATURES in version 2.1.0.

This release couple of minor parser enchancements:

1. Varargs suport
   Added support for methods with variable number of arguments. Since the
   information about varargs is not available via reflection, the support
   is extended to all methods having an array as their last argument. This
   provides additional convenience, since the array argument is created
   automatically by the compiler. The variable argument methods are subject
   to the same method overloading rules as other methods.

2. Warnings cleanup
   Cleaned up the warnings by the JDK 7 compiler mostly by using Class<?>
   instead of Class. However, since Java does not consider parametrized
   types with compatible parameters compatible, this had resulted in one
   incompatible API change: the last argument (cnmap, defining class names,
   usable inside JEL expressions for downcasting) of the 5-argument version
   of the gnu.jel.Library constructor now is HashMap<String,Class<?>>
   instead of HashMap<String,Class> used previously. These types are
   considered incompatible by javac, which produces a compiler error for
   the code using the former definition. This error should be easy to fix.

3. Removed long deprecated gnu.jel.Library constructors.
   Now the only way to instantiate the gnu.jel.Library is to use
   its 5-argument constructor. The unused parameters can be simply
   set to null (as deprecated constructors did).

4. Some minor spelling fixes in the documentation.
